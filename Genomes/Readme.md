# PAT Genomes

This folder contains information about a set of genomic sequences that are included in the PAT system. 
These sequences were initially obtained from NCBI RefSeq database in around 2013, and they were a subject of close examination over the course of more than ten years. 
One of the main benefits of this dataset is the balance between representatives from different bacterial and phage species. 
Unfortunately, many modern genomic datasets are heavily skewed towards certain pathogenic and/or lab organisms. 
The PAT genomes consist of bacteriophage, prophage, and bacterial genomic sequences. There are 2873 genomic sequences in total.

### **PAT_ids.txt**
This text file contains a list of NCBI IDs of the PAT genomic sequences. 
Each NCBI ID is given on a new line, and no additional separator symbols are used.
