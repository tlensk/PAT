#### Abstract
<p>Head assembly in tailed bacteriophages is a highly conserved yet adaptable process that builds an icosahedral capsid able to withstand high packaging densities and protect phage DNA. Here we conduct a large-scale bioinformatic analysis of phage head morphogenetic modules and situate this analysis within the current structural and evolutionary understanding of tailed bacteriophages. Using a training set of more than 600 phage complete genomes (<100 Kbp) annotated with the Phage Annotation Toolkit (PAT) using our in-house curated library of Pfam-derived and custom HMM families, we (i) map head modules (e.g., portal, major head, scaffolding proteins, proteases, decoration/accessory proteins, and head-tail joining proteins), (ii) define co-occurrence “neighborhoods” of HMM families that underpin proper head assembly, and (iii) relate module arrangements to biological and evolutionary patterns. We integrate recent cryo-EM and structural genomics findings on the HK97-like fold, scaffold-portal interactions, and protease-driven maturation to interpret co-occurrence patterns and propose testable hypotheses for evolution and functional relationships within head morphogenetic regions. This analysis provides a framework for more accurate annotation and predictive classification of head morphogenetic regions in newly sequenced phages and suggests experimental priorities to validate inferred interactions.</p>

#### 1.	Introduction
<p>Bacteriophages are the most abundant biological entities on Earth and are major drivers of microbial ecology and evolution (Koskella & Brockhurst, 2014). They shape bacterial population dynamics (Suttle, 2007), mediate horizontal gene transfer (Brüssow et al., 2004), and influence biogeochemical cycles (Fuhrman, 1999); phages are also of useful in agriculture (Au et al., 2022), and they are revisited as therapeutics for many antibiotic-resistant infections (Kortright et al., 2019). The vast majority of phages are tailed phages, order Caudovirales (Ackermann, 2007) which package double-stranded DNA inside an icosahedral capsid (head) and use a tail apparatus for host recognition and genome delivery. Recent high-throughput sequencing dramatically increased the number and diversity of available phage genomes, generating both opportunity and the need for robust automated annotation and comparative frameworks for phage morphogenetic modules.</p>
<p>Phage head morphogenesis is a multicomponent process with modular genetics: a portal complex nucleates assembly at a unique vertex; major head proteins, typically adopting an HK97-like fold, assemble into procapsids under the guidance of scaffolding proteins; dedicated proteases often cleave scaffolds (and also themselves) to permit capsid maturation and DNA packaging; accessory proteins (decoration or stabilization factors) and head-tail joining proteins complete the head assembly. Many structural and biochemical features of these head morphogenetic modules are conserved across distant phage lineages, yet sequence diversity and gene order variability complicate automated functional assignment and classification. Recent high-resolution cryo-EM and comparative studies have clarified several conserved structural themes (for example, the pervasiveness of the HK97 fold and scaffold-mediated assembly), offering anchors for bioinformatic inference (Duda & Teschke, 2019).</p>
<p>A unifying feature of tailed bacteriophages is the widespread use of the HK97-like fold in their major head proteins (MHs). Despite dramatic sequence divergence across phage families, the three-dimensional architecture of the HK97-fold has remained remarkably conserved and provides the mechanical resilience needed for capsid expansion, stabilization, and retention of highly pressurized DNA. This remarkable structural conservation across viruses - extending even to herpesviruses - highlights the evolutionary success of the HK97 paradigm. At the same time, it explains why simple sequence comparison is often insufficient to identify MHs in newly sequenced genomes. The fold can tolerate extensive sequence variation, which obscures homology at the primary-sequence level, making Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and profile-based approaches essential for reliable annotation.</p>
<p>Understanding the centrality of the MH naturally leads to the proteins that support its assembly, particularly the head scaffolding proteins (HSs). Whether encoded as independent proteins or fused as domains in MHs, scaffolding components play a dual role: they guide newly synthesized MHs into the correct stereometric arrangement and ensure efficient incorporation of the portal complex. Cryo-EM reconstructions of procapsids and assembly intermediates reveal that HSs form dynamic oligomeric networks, stabilizing the immature shell while preventing premature expansion (Chen et al., 2011; Ignatiou et al., 2019). As maturation proceeds, these scaffolding elements are removed, either through dissociation or proteolytic cleavage, permitting the head lattice to undergo the characteristic conformational transitions required for DNA packaging. Importantly, recent structural studies show that scaffolding proteins do not act in isolation but interact intimately with the portal protein, positioning it correctly at the unique vertex and ensuring that only a single portal complex is incorporated.</p>
<p>The portal protein (PO) itself represents another conserved component of head morphogenesis. Forming a dodecameric ring that occupies a single specialized vertex of the capsid, the portal serves as the gateway through which DNA enters during packaging and later exits during infection. Its architecture is adapted to interface both with the internal scaffolding environment during procapsid formation and with the powerful ATP-driven packaging motor consisting of terminases (including large and small subunits) that docks onto it in later steps. The timing of portal incorporation is therefore tightly regulated, and defects in portal-scaffold coordination often lead to malformed particles or empty “ghost” heads. Because the portal also functions at the head-tail junction, its conformation must remain compatible with tail attachment, making it a focal point of mechanical and regulatory integration during morphogenesis.</p>
<p>As the prohead transitions toward its mature form, proteolytic activity becomes essential. Many phages encode dedicated head proteases (HPs) that cleave scaffolding proteins, remove internal peptides, or activate maturation-specific structural rearrangements. These proteases often share conserved catalytic motifs across phage families, despite frequent variation in size and domain architecture. Their evolutionary distribution provides important clues about the diversity of maturation pathways: some lineages retain proteases as indispensable components of assembly, whereas others, especially podoviruses, have evolved protease-independent mechanisms in which scaffolding domains dissociate spontaneously. The presence or absence of a maturation protease thus reflects deeper evolutionary strategies for controlling head expansion and stabilization.</p>
<p>Finally, the structural integrity of the mature head is further shaped by accessory or stabilizing proteins. These include external decoration proteins (HDs) that bind to capsid facets, internal or external crosslinks such as the isopeptide bonds characteristic of bacteriophage HK97, and extended loops or insertions in the MH itself that reinforce weak points in the lattice. The diversity of these accessories often scales with head size and the mechanical demands placed on it. Jumbo phages, for example, frequently encode multiple auxiliary stabilizers to maintain head rigidity under extreme internal pressure. In contrast, smaller phages may rely on minimal or no decoration. These variations underscore the modular nature of head evolution: although the HK97 fold provides the foundational architecture, accessory proteins fine-tune mechanical performance to meet lineage-specific requirements.</p>
<p>Together, these components - the conserved HK97-fold , the scaffolding system that shapes it, the portal complex that organizes assembly around a unique vertex, the proteases that orchestrate maturation, and the array of accessory stabilizers - form an integrated and evolutionarily flexible toolkit. Their interplay illustrates how phage head morphogenesis balances deep structural conservation with remarkable adaptability, enabling tailed phages to thrive across diverse ecological contexts and to evolve new strategies while preserving core architectural principles.</p>
<p>In this study we advance the previous work related to the Phage Annotation Toolkit (Vladimirov et al., 2022) and HMM-based annotation to: (1) present a systematic view of head morphogenetic proteins and their functional roles; (2) analyze module co-occurrence across more than 600 genomes in our genome set using our curated collection of HMM families to define “morphogenetic neighborhoods”; and (3) synthesize functional and evolutionary interpretations that reconcile conserved structural features with variable genomic contexts.</p>

#### 2.	Materials and Methods

##### 2.1.	 Dataset and Annotation Workflow
<p>We assembled a curated training dataset of more than 600 complete phage genomes of length not exciding 100 Kbp (Fig.1A) and representing the classical Caudovirales lineages that infect Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, we utilized well-characterized phages such as Lambda-like, HK97, Mu, P2, P22, and others, as paradigm phages for downstream classification. Additional large complete genomes (greater than 100 Kbp) were explored but not included in the main training set (Table S1). All genomes were annotated using our in-house Phage Annotation Toolkit (PAT) that draws on three primary resources: (i) BLAST searches against an internal annotated genome library, (ii) HMMER searches (iii) a continually expanding collection of manually curated phage-specific HMM families derived from experimentally validated morphogenetic proteins.</p>

<p>A key aim of the developed workflow was to detect conserved structural functions within morphogenetic regions, including many initially unannotated ORFs. For each unannotated protein, the pipeline first performed BLAST searches followed by MUSCLE alignments. These alignments were queried against Pfam and PAT HMM libraries to identify candidate functional domains. Putative hits were evaluated using two criteria: (a) HMMER bitscore/E-value support, and (b) consistency with the genomic order for that lineage. When these conditions were met, manual curation proceeded via PAT’s “create HMM” interface, producing new composite HMMs that were added to the functional categories maintained by PAT. In total, PAT tracks above 30 morphogenetic functions central to phage head and tail assembly (Table. S2), with additional 20 functions relevant to phage infection and propagation (not shown). Each new HMM family expands the toolkit’s ability to annotate divergent structural proteins, increasing coverage across diverse phage groups.</p>
<p>To build robust models for conserved head-related morphogenetic functions: portal, major head, scaffolding, protease, head-tail joining, and various decoration and accessory proteins, we clustered annotated sequences and generated multiple sequence alignments to construct profile HMMs. Both Pfam families and PAT-derived HMMs were used to maximize sensitivity to remote homologs. All HMM searches were conducted using HMMER3 with permissive detection thresholds to reduce false negatives; resulting hits were then manually filtered to remove false implausible domain architectures, to filter out false negatives, and to validate consistency with known head-tail genomic organization.</p>


##### 2.2. Primary Classification of Phage Genomes

<p>Initial classification of genomes relied on a combination of annotated morphogenetic functions, conserved gene order, and global genome organization signatures. Using in-house scripts, we first clustered genomes with similar morphogenetic region layouts and gene-order profiles into a preliminary “filtered genome pool.” Each genome in this pool was then analyzed and assigned to one of the head morphotypes that we had defined. For each head morphotype, we defined a fixed set of structural parameters corresponding to the core head functions that collectively define the prototypical morphogenetic region architecture. Genomes exhibiting these parameters in the expected order were retained; sequences with atypical organizations were designated as “outlier genomes.”</p>

##### 2.3. Subclassification of Outlier Genomes

<p>A second round of clustering was performed on the outlier pool. In contrast to the primary classification, which emphasized global genome organization, subclassification relied more heavily on local gene order within morphogenetic regions. Custom scripts extracted gene-order patterns surrounding key structural markers, and genomes were iteratively grouped based on recurrent arrangements. Manual curation ensured that novel or divergent lineages were not mis-assigned. This two-step strategy: primary classification followed by localized gene-order-based subclassification, enabled accurate categorization of the phage genome dataset.</p>

##### 2.4. Co-occurrence Analysis and Neighborhood Detection

<p>To investigate conserved functional neighborhoods, we constructed binary presence/absence matrices of the HMM families across the annotated genomes. Pairwise association statistics were used to identify HMM families that co-occur often. We extended this analysis using custom Python neighborhood detection scripts. Within each major morphotype cluster, a designated anchor HMM - typically the portal protein, present and accurately annotated in the genomes - served as the starting point. For each genome, all HMM families within ±5 genes of the anchor were extracted, and genomes sharing similar local family compositions were grouped. This procedure yielded “morphogenetic neighborhoods”: recurring sets of HMM families that interact to form characteristic morphogenetic units.</p>
<p>To explore higher-order relationships among HMM families, co-occurrence data were visualized as interaction networks using Cystoscape. Nodes represented individual HMM families, and edges reflected statistically supported associations. Network topology helped identify stable morphogenetic module configurations and functionally coupled families across lineages. These interactions were subsequently distilled into schematic representations presented in the Results section.</p>
