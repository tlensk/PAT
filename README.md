#### Abstract
<p>Head assembly in tailed bacteriophages is a highly conserved yet adaptable process that builds an icosahedral capsid able to withstand high packaging densities and protect phage DNA. Here we conduct a large-scale bioinformatic analysis of phage head morphogenetic modules and situate this analysis within the current structural and evolutionary understanding of tailed bacteriophages. Using a training set of more than 600 phage complete genomes (<100 Kbp) annotated with the Phage Annotation Toolkit (PAT) using our in-house curated library of Pfam-derived and custom HMM families, we (i) map head modules (e.g., portal, major head, scaffolding proteins, proteases, decoration/accessory proteins, and head-tail joining proteins), (ii) define co-occurrence “neighborhoods” of HMM families that underpin proper head assembly, and (iii) relate module arrangements to biological and evolutionary patterns. We integrate recent cryo-EM and structural genomics findings on the HK97-like fold, scaffold-portal interactions, and protease-driven maturation to interpret co-occurrence patterns and propose testable hypotheses for evolution and functional relationships within head morphogenetic regions. This analysis provides a framework for more accurate annotation and predictive classification of head morphogenetic regions in newly sequenced phages and suggests experimental priorities to validate inferred interactions.</p>

#### 1.	Introduction
<p>Bacteriophages are the most abundant biological entities on Earth and are major drivers of microbial ecology and evolution (Koskella & Brockhurst, 2014). They shape bacterial population dynamics (Suttle, 2007), mediate horizontal gene transfer (Brüssow et al., 2004), and influence biogeochemical cycles (Fuhrman, 1999); phages are also of useful in agriculture (Au et al., 2022), and they are revisited as therapeutics for many antibiotic-resistant infections (Kortright et al., 2019). The vast majority of phages are tailed phages, order Caudovirales (Ackermann, 2007) which package double-stranded DNA inside an icosahedral capsid (head) and use a tail apparatus for host recognition and genome delivery. Recent high-throughput sequencing dramatically increased the number and diversity of available phage genomes, generating both opportunity and the need for robust automated annotation and comparative frameworks for phage morphogenetic modules.</p>
<p>Phage head morphogenesis is a multicomponent process with modular genetics: a portal complex nucleates assembly at a unique vertex; major head proteins, typically adopting an HK97-like fold, assemble into procapsids under the guidance of scaffolding proteins; dedicated proteases often cleave scaffolds (and also themselves) to permit capsid maturation and DNA packaging; accessory proteins (decoration or stabilization factors) and head-tail joining proteins complete the head assembly. Many structural and biochemical features of these head morphogenetic modules are conserved across distant phage lineages, yet sequence diversity and gene order variability complicate automated functional assignment and classification. Recent high-resolution cryo-EM and comparative studies have clarified several conserved structural themes (for example, the pervasiveness of the HK97 fold and scaffold-mediated assembly), offering anchors for bioinformatic inference (Duda & Teschke, 2019).</p>
<p>A unifying feature of tailed bacteriophages is the widespread use of the HK97-like fold in their major head proteins (MHs). Despite dramatic sequence divergence across phage families, the three-dimensional architecture of the HK97-fold has remained remarkably conserved and provides the mechanical resilience needed for capsid expansion, stabilization, and retention of highly pressurized DNA. This remarkable structural conservation across viruses - extending even to herpesviruses - highlights the evolutionary success of the HK97 paradigm. At the same time, it explains why simple sequence comparison is often insufficient to identify MHs in newly sequenced genomes. The fold can tolerate extensive sequence variation, which obscures homology at the primary-sequence level, making Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and profile-based approaches essential for reliable annotation.</p>
<p>Understanding the centrality of the MH naturally leads to the proteins that support its assembly, particularly the head scaffolding proteins (HSs). Whether encoded as independent proteins or fused as domains in MHs, scaffolding components play a dual role: they guide newly synthesized MHs into the correct stereometric arrangement and ensure efficient incorporation of the portal complex. Cryo-EM reconstructions of procapsids and assembly intermediates reveal that HSs form dynamic oligomeric networks, stabilizing the immature shell while preventing premature expansion (Chen et al., 2011; Ignatiou et al., 2019). As maturation proceeds, these scaffolding elements are removed, either through dissociation or proteolytic cleavage, permitting the head lattice to undergo the characteristic conformational transitions required for DNA packaging. Importantly, recent structural studies show that scaffolding proteins do not act in isolation but interact intimately with the portal protein, positioning it correctly at the unique vertex and ensuring that only a single portal complex is incorporated.</p>
<p>The portal protein (PO) itself represents another conserved component of head morphogenesis. Forming a dodecameric ring that occupies a single specialized vertex of the capsid, the portal serves as the gateway through which DNA enters during packaging and later exits during infection. Its architecture is adapted to interface both with the internal scaffolding environment during procapsid formation and with the powerful ATP-driven packaging motor consisting of terminases (including large and small subunits) that docks onto it in later steps. The timing of portal incorporation is therefore tightly regulated, and defects in portal-scaffold coordination often lead to malformed particles or empty “ghost” heads. Because the portal also functions at the head-tail junction, its conformation must remain compatible with tail attachment, making it a focal point of mechanical and regulatory integration during morphogenesis.</p>
<p>As the prohead transitions toward its mature form, proteolytic activity becomes essential. Many phages encode dedicated head proteases (HPs) that cleave scaffolding proteins, remove internal peptides, or activate maturation-specific structural rearrangements. These proteases often share conserved catalytic motifs across phage families, despite frequent variation in size and domain architecture. Their evolutionary distribution provides important clues about the diversity of maturation pathways: some lineages retain proteases as indispensable components of assembly, whereas others, especially podoviruses, have evolved protease-independent mechanisms in which scaffolding domains dissociate spontaneously. The presence or absence of a maturation protease thus reflects deeper evolutionary strategies for controlling head expansion and stabilization.</p>
<p>Finally, the structural integrity of the mature head is further shaped by accessory or stabilizing proteins. These include external decoration proteins (HDs) that bind to capsid facets, internal or external crosslinks such as the isopeptide bonds characteristic of bacteriophage HK97, and extended loops or insertions in the MH itself that reinforce weak points in the lattice. The diversity of these accessories often scales with head size and the mechanical demands placed on it. Jumbo phages, for example, frequently encode multiple auxiliary stabilizers to maintain head rigidity under extreme internal pressure. In contrast, smaller phages may rely on minimal or no decoration. These variations underscore the modular nature of head evolution: although the HK97 fold provides the foundational architecture, accessory proteins fine-tune mechanical performance to meet lineage-specific requirements.</p>
<p>Together, these components - the conserved HK97-fold , the scaffolding system that shapes it, the portal complex that organizes assembly around a unique vertex, the proteases that orchestrate maturation, and the array of accessory stabilizers - form an integrated and evolutionarily flexible toolkit. Their interplay illustrates how phage head morphogenesis balances deep structural conservation with remarkable adaptability, enabling tailed phages to thrive across diverse ecological contexts and to evolve new strategies while preserving core architectural principles.</p>
<p>In this study we advance the previous work related to the Phage Annotation Toolkit (Vladimirov et al., 2022) and HMM-based annotation to: (1) present a systematic view of head morphogenetic proteins and their functional roles; (2) analyze module co-occurrence across more than 600 genomes in our genome set using our curated collection of HMM families to define “morphogenetic neighborhoods”; and (3) synthesize functional and evolutionary interpretations that reconcile conserved structural features with variable genomic contexts.</p>

#### 2.	Materials and Methods

##### 2.1.	 Dataset and Annotation Workflow
<p>We assembled a curated training dataset of more than 600 complete phage genomes of length not exciding 100 Kbp (<strong>Fig.1A</strong>) and representing the classical Caudovirales lineages that infect Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (<strong>Fig.1B</strong>). In addition, we utilized well-characterized phages such as Lambda-like, HK97, Mu, P2, P22, and others, as paradigm phages for downstream classification. Additional large complete genomes (greater than 100 Kbp) were explored but not included in the main training set (Table S1). All genomes were annotated using our in-house Phage Annotation Toolkit (PAT) that draws on three primary resources: (i) BLAST searches against an internal annotated genome library, (ii) HMMER searches (iii) a continually expanding collection of manually curated phage-specific HMM families derived from experimentally validated morphogenetic proteins.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Fig.1.</strong> Summary of the phage genomes: (A) distribution of genome length and GC-content; <br>(B) distribution of tail morphology and phage hosts.</p>


<p>A key aim of the developed workflow was to detect conserved structural functions within morphogenetic regions, including many initially unannotated ORFs. For each unannotated protein, the pipeline first performed BLAST searches followed by MUSCLE alignments. These alignments were queried against Pfam and PAT HMM libraries to identify candidate functional domains. Putative hits were evaluated using two criteria: (a) HMMER bitscore/E-value support, and (b) consistency with the genomic order for that lineage. When these conditions were met, manual curation proceeded via PAT’s “create HMM” interface, producing new composite HMMs that were added to the functional categories maintained by PAT. In total, PAT tracks above 30 morphogenetic functions central to phage head and tail assembly (Table. S2), with additional 20 functions relevant to phage infection and propagation (not shown). Each new HMM family expands the toolkit’s ability to annotate divergent structural proteins, increasing coverage across diverse phage groups.</p>
<p>To build robust models for conserved head-related morphogenetic functions: portal, major head, scaffolding, protease, head-tail joining, and various decoration and accessory proteins, we clustered annotated sequences and generated multiple sequence alignments to construct profile HMMs. Both Pfam families and PAT-derived HMMs were used to maximize sensitivity to remote homologs. All HMM searches were conducted using HMMER3 with permissive detection thresholds to reduce false negatives; resulting hits were then manually filtered to remove false implausible domain architectures, to filter out false negatives, and to validate consistency with known head-tail genomic organization.</p>


##### 2.2. Primary Classification of Phage Genomes

<p>Initial classification of genomes relied on a combination of annotated morphogenetic functions, conserved gene order, and global genome organization signatures. Using in-house scripts, we first clustered genomes with similar morphogenetic region layouts and gene-order profiles into a preliminary “filtered genome pool.” Each genome in this pool was then analyzed and assigned to one of the head morphotypes that we had defined. For each head morphotype, we defined a fixed set of structural parameters corresponding to the core head functions that collectively define the prototypical morphogenetic region architecture. Genomes exhibiting these parameters in the expected order were retained; sequences with atypical organizations were designated as “outlier genomes.”</p>

##### 2.3. Subclassification of Outlier Genomes

<p>A second round of clustering was performed on the outlier pool. In contrast to the primary classification, which emphasized global genome organization, subclassification relied more heavily on local gene order within morphogenetic regions. Custom scripts extracted gene-order patterns surrounding key structural markers, and genomes were iteratively grouped based on recurrent arrangements. Manual curation ensured that novel or divergent lineages were not mis-assigned. This two-step strategy: primary classification followed by localized gene-order-based subclassification, enabled accurate categorization of the phage genome dataset.</p>

##### 2.4. Co-occurrence Analysis and Neighborhood Detection

<p>To investigate conserved functional neighborhoods, we constructed binary presence/absence matrices of the HMM families across the annotated genomes. Pairwise association statistics were used to identify HMM families that co-occur often. We extended this analysis using custom Python neighborhood detection scripts. Within each major morphotype cluster, a designated anchor HMM - typically the portal protein, present and accurately annotated in the genomes - served as the starting point. For each genome, all HMM families within ±5 genes of the anchor were extracted, and genomes sharing similar local family compositions were grouped. This procedure yielded “morphogenetic neighborhoods”: recurring sets of HMM families that interact to form characteristic morphogenetic units.</p>
<p>To explore higher-order relationships among HMM families, co-occurrence data were visualized as interaction networks using Cystoscape. Nodes represented individual HMM families, and edges reflected statistically supported associations. Network topology helped identify stable morphogenetic module configurations and functionally coupled families across lineages. These interactions were subsequently distilled into schematic representations presented in the Results section.</p>


#### 3.	Results
##### 3.1. Detection of Conserved Morphogenetic Functions in Tailed Phages

<p>A central aim of this study was to carefully define and detect key head-related functions in the phage morphogenetic region (PMR), the genomic locus encoding the core structural modules required for phage particle formation and further successful propagation. Because the PMR provides a stable structural framework across Caudovirales, accurate identification of the underlying protein families is essential for any comparative or classification-oriented analysis.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we defined structural-functional categories (modules) using the Phage Annotation Toolkit (PAT), each represented by multiple composite HMMs. These composite models integrate Pfam profiles with a growing collection of custom-generated HMMs curated from experimentally characterized and computationally analyzed morphogenetic proteins. Homology detection relied primarily on HMMER3, which provides greater sensitivity for divergent phage proteins than BLAST or PSI-BLAST. Searches were performed using a high-confidence probability threshold (90%), enabling precise annotation of head-associated functions including large and small terminase subunits, portal protein, major head protein, scaffold proteins, head-tail joining proteins, decoration/auxiliary proteins, and where present, head proteases.</p>
<p>Across the phage genomes in our training dataset, PAT successfully annotated more than half of the PMR-related functions in most categories, with portal (PO), large terminase (LT), and major head (MH) families exceeding 90% coverage (<strong>Table 1.</strong>). As the annotation pipeline matured, we incorporated automated detection of previously unannotated ORFs and manual curation of new families, ultimately expanding the library to almost 400 HMM families that collectively annotated several thousand of proteins previously labeled as hypothetical or of unknown function. These expanded annotations substantially improved the resolution of PMR detection in the phage genomes and provided the basis for subsequent classification.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="Table 1." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5393f80-3e6d-4ab4-9f19-c8e865560e54" /></p>


<p>We grouped phages into main branches by using the relative order of three conserved head-associated modules: portal (PO), major head (MH), and large terminase (LT), as a simple, biologically meaningful signature of head-region general organization. Empirically, these genes tend to cluster within a compact morphogenetic locus and their local ordering is relatively conserved within lineages, so differences in their arrangement frequently reflect alternative assembly strategies and evolutionary histories, not random rearrangements. Comparative genomic studies and reviews of phage genome architecture document this stability: morphogenetic genes (including terminases, portal and major head proteins) are commonly found together in the same genomic neighborhood and their ordering has been used as a phylogenomic and classification cue.</p>
<p>Structural and functional work further supports the biological basis of this ordering because the terminase, portal and major head interact during packaging and assembly and have relationships that impose constraints on which gene products must be co-localized. More recent genomic surveys and comparative analyses have exploited MH and terminase phylogenies together with conserved gene synteny to partition phage diversity into clusters and subclusters, demonstrating that module order is a robust feature for grouping related genomes at coarse taxonomic scales.  In practice, we extracted the local gene order for PO, MH, and LT (and also small terminase where present) from each genome and use it as main axis of similarity in our clustering pipeline. This approach therefore couples mechanistic insight (which proteins must functionally interact) with comparative genomics evidence (which genes remain syntenic across lineages) to produce phylogenetically and functionally meaningful main branches (<strong>Fig.2</strong>).</p>

##### 3.2. Primary Classification of Phage Genomes

Following annotation, we classified the genomes according to the organization and composition of their morphogenetic regions. Genomes containing a complete, interpretable PMR were included in a filtered genome pool, which contained several clusters differing in the number and arrangement of head-associated modules. These clusters were then mapped onto main Caudovirales head morphotypes using a semi-automated workflow that compared function order, neighborhood composition, and global genomic architecture. We defined seven main head types corresponded to paradigm phage morphotypes (<strong>Table 2.</strong>). 
Their genomic organizations, including the characteristic ordering of terminase, portal, scaffold, major head, protease (when present), and head-tail joining proteins, provided the backbone for primary classification. This initial assignment placed the majority of genomes into well-defined groups while leaving a smaller collection of “outlier” genomes that required deeper examination. Across all genomes, five core morphogenetic modules were nearly universal: portal protein, major head proteins, a scaffold protein (either separate or MH-fused), a head protease (in protease-containing lineages), and a head–tail joining protein. Our analysis uncovered a limited number of recurrent arrangements shared across multiple phage genomes.

##### 3.3. HMM Co-Occurrence and Morphogenetic Neighborhoods 

<p>To explore functional and evolutionary relationships beyond simple presence/absence, we examined the co-occurrence of HMM families within local PMR neighborhoods. Because each morphogenetic function is represented by multiple HMM families, reflecting the deep sequence diversity of phage proteins, co-occurrence patterns reveal how specific structural modules preferentially assemble into higher-order architectural solutions.</p>
<p>Detailed examination at the HMM-family level revealed strikingly specific patterns of co-occurrence. For example, the portal protein represented by 13 distinct HMM families showed strong lineage-specific associations. Most HMM families mapped uniquely to one of the seven major phage groups. For example, the PO-P22 HMM hits were present in phages with P22 head type. Portal HMM families consistently associated with distinct scaffold and protease families, initiating divergent downstream organization of the PMR. These observations demonstrate that co-occurrence of HMM families predicts PMR synteny, implying that modular compatibility between portal, scaffold, protease, and MH families shapes both local gene order and head morphogenesis.</p>
<p>Patterns of co-occurrence also revealed functionally meaningful associations. For example, certain scaffold families consistently co-occurred with specific portal families, implying conserved HS-portal interaction surfaces that mirror recently visualized cryo-EM structures. Likewise, recurrent associations between specific protease-like HMM families and particular scaffold families suggest co-evolution of cleavage motifs and protease specificity. These interaction signatures highlight promising candidates for experimental validation using mutagenesis, structural analysis, and crosslinking, and they provide testable hypotheses for uncovering alternative assembly strategies and functional replacements within PMR evolution.</p>


##### 3.4. Subclassification of Atypical or Ambiguous Genomes

<p>Genomes that resisted primary classification due to atypical synteny were reanalyzed using their co-occurrence neighborhood profiles. This second stage of clustering emphasized gene order and local family context rather than global organization. Many outlier genomes were reassigned to appropriate subgroups when their PMR neighborhoods were considered, aligning classification not only with observed synteny but also with predicted MH structural class and accessory module composition.</p>

##### 3.5. Simple and Complex Head Architectures

<p>The combined neighborhood and synteny analyses allowed us to propose a novel organizational framework that categorizes heads along a spectrum from simple to complex. Simple heads, such as P22, contain a minimal set of modules (ST-LT-PO-HS-MH). Moderately complex heads, including HK97 types, incorporate additional connectors and sometimes proteases.  In addition, heads, such as SPP1, add specialized modules like the HIJ ejection protein. Highly specialized heads, including Mu, Lambda, and P2 types, show unusual features such as incorporation of tail completion proteins (Mu) or unconventional gene ordering starting at the portal (P2).</p>
<p>Interestingly, simple heads exhibit greater HMM-level diversity, with multiple alternative neighborhoods, whereas complex heads rely on highly conserved, lineage-specific family combinations. This inversion simple genomic architecture but complex family diversity suggests that structural simplicity may permit greater evolutionary experimentation at the sequence-family level.</p>

#### 4.	Discussion
##### 4.1. Careful annotation of head morphogenetic modules enables biologically meaningful classification

<p>A central contribution of this study is the demonstration that accurate identification of phage head morphogenetic functions, particularly the head scaffold and head protease, enables robust classification of tailed bacteriophages into biologically coherent groups. Using a curated library of HMM families, we classified more than 600 Caudovirales genomes into seven main head types, each defined by a characteristic morphogenetic content and syntenic organization in their head regions. These categories reflect fundamental differences in head assembly strategies, reinforcing long-standing observations from classical structural virology (Rao & Black, 2010).</p>
<p>Among these components, the head scaffold and head protease emerged as the most critical yet historically under-annotated functions. Scaffold proteins are frequently short, rapidly evolving, and structurally disordered in their C-terminal region, making them difficult to recognize using sequence-based approaches alone. Misannotation of scaffolds as proteases or their omission entirely has long impeded comparative analysis of head assembly pathways. Our pipeline addresses this challenge by combining HMM-based profiles with contextual cues from synteny, co-occurrence, and conserved domain architecture, allowing confident discrimination of scaffold from protease families and preventing systematic cross-annotation. This enabled us to define essential components required for head formation and maturation: terminase, portal, scaffold, major head, and protease (when present), providing a universal framework for head module annotation across Caudovirales.</p>
<p>Our analysis further demonstrates that phage genome usually requires a scaffold, even in lineages that lack a protease. Classical systems such as P22, and several SPP1-like lineages, assemble their capsids without a dedicated protease, yet all retain a recognizable scaffold domain. This observation confirms that scaffold-MH and scaffold-PO interaction represent the fundamental determinant of prohead assembly.</p>

##### 4.2. Structural insights explain conserved HMM neighborhoods and interaction constraints
<p>Integration of our HMM neighborhood analysis with structural data from cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography provides mechanistic explanations for why certain families consistently co-occur. The MH HK97-fold, with its maturation-linked expansion and capacity for covalent chainmail formation, creates strict constraints on its interaction partners. These constraints explain the recurrent triad of PO-HS-MH families in canonical HK97-like genomes: scaffold removal (either by protease-mediated cleavage or dissociation) is prerequisite to enabling the conformational transitions characteristic of HK97-fold maturation.</p>
<p>Similarly, portal-scaffold coupling emerges as a deeply conserved interaction that defines the earliest assembly step. The portal ring is often the first component incorporated into the assembling procapsid, and scaffolds (or scaffold domains fused to MH) nucleate correct portal insertion. Published density maps from P22 and HK97 procapsids directly support our inference that portal and scaffold families form a constrained HMM neighborhood. Our observation that portal families dictate downstream head-module composition is therefore a natural consequence of these physical interactions. These structural constraints propagate downward into synteny: portal choice defines scaffold family compatibility, which in turn governs MH family recruitment. Thus, genomic architecture mirrors assembly biology, and the gene order is not arbitrary.</p>
<p>The strong modularity of HMM neighborhoods suggests that phage head morphogenesis evolves through repeated cycles of module retention, replacement, and domain remodeling. Two non-exclusive evolutionary processes are supported by our dataset:</p>

1.	Vertical descent with domain remodeling.
An ancestral HK97-like MH-scaffold toolkit appears to have diversified through insertions, deletions, and domain swaps that preserve fold-level constraints while altering surface chemistries. This explains the coexistence of deeply conserved portal–scaffold interactions with extensive sequence divergence across MH families.

2.	Horizontal acquisition and non-orthologous replacement.
Many genomes encode alternative scaffolds, modified proteases, or distinct accessory stabilizers without altering higher-level assembly pathways. These replacements produce mosaics in which conserved structural roles are fulfilled by diverse HMM families, consistent with the repeated appearance of functionally equivalent but non-homologous modules across the dataset.
These findings reinforce a modular evolutionary model in which a small set of essential assembly functions are preserved, while the proteins performing those functions can be exchanged, fused, or split depending on lineage-specific needs.

##### 4.3. Neighborhoods reveal HMM co-occurrence and lineage-specific assembly logic
<p>An unexpected but powerful result of our analysis is the discovery of HMM-level “morphogenetic neighborhoods”, or co-occurrence patterns in which specific families consistently select a restricted set of compatible partners. This phenomenon is most evident in key functions such as portal and scaffold proteins, which define the acceptable interaction space for other head components. Each of the seven major morphotypes possesses distinct patterns in portal families, and these portal families in turn recruit specific scaffold, protease, and MH partners. This phenomenon is not restricted to a few special cases: nearly all major lineages exhibit reproducible, family-specific neighborhoods. Thus, HMM neighborhoods reflect lineage-specific biochemical compatibilities shaped by structure and recombination constraints.</p>
<p>Because PO-HS-MH interactions impose constraints on head assembly, variations in these modules produce predictable changes in synteny. In many phages the canonical head morphogenesis order is as follows: PO-HS-MH, but alternative architectures are present. In some lineages (for example P2) the scaffold and protease functions are encoded in a single multifunctional polypeptide, whereas in HK97 and HK97-like phages the scaffold-like “delta” domain is fused into the N-terminus of the MH protein and processed during maturation. These different solutions including fusion or absence of protease genes produce distinct syntenic blocks, reflecting the existing alternative assembly strategies.</p>


##### 4.4. Biological and technological implications 
<p>Head scaffold proteins displayed a striking division of labor between conserved and variable regions. Across diverse lineages, scaffolds share a highly conserved N-terminal helical segment, which mediates binding to a single portal family, while their C-terminal regions are highly variable, allowing recruitment of multiple distinct MH families. This architecture explains why simple heads (minimal module sets) often exhibit greater HMM-level diversity: their modular interactions allow broad combinatorial variation downstream of a conserved portal-scaffold pair.</p>
<p>Although phage tails play the dominant role in host recognition, our analysis suggests that head architecture contributes to host range and infection dynamics. Simple heads, with flexible scaffold–MH partnerships, exhibit greater diversity and broader host specificity, while complex and specialized heads show limited HMM diversity. This pattern may reflect an evolutionary strategy in which conserved interior regions ensure structural integrity, while variable exterior capsid surfaces diversify interactions with host environments, immune barriers, or surface structures. Head diversity may therefore act as an auxiliary compensatory mechanism for phages to cope with bacterial evolution.
<p>Neighborhood-aware annotation significantly improves functional detection, particularly for small or divergent proteins like scaffolds. Because neighborhood profiles reflect assembly biology, they provide a classification scheme more informative than sequence alone. For applications in therapeutic phage selection or synthetic capsid engineering, understanding a phage’s assembly strategy is more actionable than its species designation. We therefore advocate incorporating neighborhood-aware annotation workflows (e.g., as implemented in PAT) into future phage genomics pipelines.
<p>Several limitations highlight opportunities for refinement. First, extremely divergent scaffold or major head proteins may evade detection. Thus, integrating structure-based annotation (e.g., AlphaFold2, ESMFold) will improve HMM sensitivity and coverage. Second, co-occurrence signals can be biased by shared ancestry; lineage-aware statistical models will help isolate functional from phylogenetic correlations.</p>
<p>Third, structural and biochemical experimental studies are required to validate predicted interactions, such as scaffold-portal binding motifs, protease substrate preferences, and MH recruitment specificity. Recent high-resolution structures of HK97, P22, and phi29 intermediates provide strong templates to guide such experiments.</p>

In addition, we suggest the following practical recommendations:
1.	Adopt neighborhood-aware annotation thresholds in automated pipelines; require at least two complementary HMM signals (e.g., portal and MH) to assign head module identities confidently.
2.	Prioritize experimental validation for (a) recurrent but uncharacterized HMM families that co-occur with known modules, and (b) genomes showing novel neighborhood compositions (candidate module replacements).
3.	Integrate structure prediction (AlphaFold) and cryo-EM docking to bridge sequence-level HMM signals with 3D mechanistic models.


#### 5.	Conclusions
<p>Phage head morphogenesis rests on a compact set of structural modules that are reused and recombined across Caudovirales. HMM family co-occurrence analysis anchored to structural knowledge about the HK97-fold, scaffolding behavior, portal architecture, and maturation proteases - reveals reproducible neighborhoods that define assembly strategies more robustly than synteny alone. Integrating neighborhood-aware annotation into pipelines such as PAT improves classification and highlights promising experimental targets for understanding and harnessing phage assembly.</p>
