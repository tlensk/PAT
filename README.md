PAT is a lightweight modular pipeline designed to streamline the annotation and comparative analysis of bacteriophage genomes. It integrates sensitive profile-based detectors for morphogenetic modules and provides tools for identifying distinct arrangements of these modules in phage genomes. PAT emphasizes interpretability: outputs include structured feature tables, visualizable gene maps, and confidence scores for each predicted function. The toolkit is suitable for large-scale analysis as well as individual genome curation. Its extensible architecture makes it easy to incorporate new HMMs, update annotation rules, or incorporate these tools into existing bioinformatics workflows.
