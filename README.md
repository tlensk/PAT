#### Abstract
<p>Head assembly in tailed bacteriophages is a highly conserved yet adaptable process that builds an icosahedral capsid able to withstand high packaging densities and protect phage DNA. Here we conduct a large-scale bioinformatic analysis of phage head morphogenetic modules and situate this analysis within the current structural and evolutionary understanding of tailed bacteriophages. Using a training set of more than 600 phage complete genomes (<100 Kbp) annotated with the Phage Annotation Toolkit (PAT) using our in-house curated library of Pfam-derived and custom HMM families, we (i) map head modules (e.g., portal, major head, scaffolding proteins, proteases, decoration/accessory proteins, and head-tail joining proteins), (ii) define co-occurrence “neighborhoods” of HMM families that underpin proper head assembly, and (iii) relate module arrangements to biological and evolutionary patterns. We integrate recent cryo-EM and structural genomics findings on the HK97-like fold, scaffold-portal interactions, and protease-driven maturation to interpret co-occurrence patterns and propose testable hypotheses for evolution and functional relationships within head morphogenetic regions. This analysis provides a framework for more accurate annotation and predictive classification of head morphogenetic regions in newly sequenced phages and suggests experimental priorities to validate inferred interactions.</p>
